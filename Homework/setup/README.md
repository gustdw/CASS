# Homework assignment: set up a computer for future homeworks

To do the homework assignments, you need a computer where all the necessary
tools are installed. So, your first assignment is to make sure you have access
to such a computer.

## Option 1: Work in the CS computer labs

If you do not have your own computer (or can not install all the required
software), you can instead use the
[computer labs of the department of computer science](https://system.cs.kuleuven.be/cs/system/wegwijs/computerklas/index-E.shtml).
All computers in the labs have the necessary tools installed. Read the
documentation about the computer labs and make sure you can log in to these
machines.

## Option 2: Setting up your own computer

The only **essential** requirements to do the homeworks is to have a
command-line shell with:

- Git (a version control system that you only need for downloading the
  assignments to your computer),
- any text editor,
- a C compiler (including the `make` tool), and
- a SystemVerilog simulator

However, it is very much recommended to also install a modern source code
editor. The recommended editor is
[Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com), available on all
major platforms (Windows, Linux and MacOS).

In addition, it will be useful to have a waveform viewer for some of the
homeworks. Two options are:

- The
  [WaveTrace extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wavetrace.wavetrace).
  With the free version you can view up to 8 simultaneous signals, which should
  be sufficient for our purposes.
- The free and open-source [GTKwave](https://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/) tool,
  that works best on Linux.

Below, we provide some pointers on how to set up all these tools on Ubuntu,
Windows and MacOS. However, we do **not** provide support for this: if you can
not get your computer set up properly, please use the computers in the labs
(Option 1 above).

### Ubuntu (Linux) computers

You can open a command-line terminal by typing `ctrl-alt-t`. You can now install
all required software by typing:

```
sudo apt -y update
sudo apt -y install git build-essential gcc gdb make iverilog gtkwave
```

Finally, consider installing VS code from the website linked above.

### Windows 11 computers

On Windows machines, the most convenient option is to install the Windows
Subsystem for Linux (WSL). You can follow the instructions provided by Microsoft
[here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/setup/environment). These
instructions also show how to install Windows Terminal and Visual Studio Code.
Both are highly recommended.

After installing WSL, you can open a terminal and type the commands below to
install the software required for the homeworks.

```
sudo apt -y update
sudo apt -y install git build-essential gcc gdb make iverilog gtkwave
```

If you use VS Code (as recommended), also install the Windows Subsystem for
Linux (WSL) extension for VS Code.

### Apple MacOS computers

Open the terminal app, and type:

```
xcode-select â€“-install
```

This will install the command-line development tools (C compiler, Git, make,
...). 

To install a SystemVerilog simulator, type:

```
brew install icarus-verilog 
```

In case the installation of the SystemVerilog simulator fails, try installing
it via MacPorts by following the instructions
[here](https://ports.macports.org/port/iverilog/). 

Finally, consider installing VS Code from the website linked above.

### Other

Some students have contributed instructions for other operating systems (many
thanks to the students that provided this information!), mainly for other Linux
distributions. We provide this here for your information, but they have not been
tested by the didactal team of the course.

#### Fedora
```
sudo dnf install -y git kernel-devel gcc gdb make iverilog gtkwave
```

#### Arch
```
sudo pacman -S git base-devel gcc gdb make iverilog gtkwave
```

## Testing your setup

Open a command-line terminal. Clone the repository with the homework assignments
by running:

```
git clone https://gitlab.kuleuven.be/distrinet/education/computer-architecture/cass-homework-student.git
```

After doing so, go to the `setup` directory.

```
cd cass-homework-student/setup
```

and type:

```
make test
```

If this prints:

```
Your C compiler works!
Your SystemVerilog simulator works!
```

then you have a working setup!
