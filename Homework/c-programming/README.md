# Homework for the Computer Architecture and System Software course

**NOTE: this repository is updated every now and then with bug fixes and

Welcome to the repository with homework assignments for the course
[Computerarchitectuur en systeemsoftware (B-KUL-H01P5B)](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/n/H01P5BN.htm).

The general rules for these homework assignments are:

- Homework assignments are _optional_ and _not graded_. They are however very
  strongly **recommended**.
- Homework assignments are, as the name implies, intended to be done on your own
  time. However, there are (more or less) weekly sessions in room ASTRONOMIA
  (Quadrivium room 01.100) where you can work on the homework together with
  fellow students and under supervision of a teaching assistant that can help
  you if you get stuck.
- Most homeworks require **preparation**, e.g., reading of the corresponding
  sections in the textbook. Please do this _before_ coming to one of the weekly
  sessions.

The very first homework (Setup environment) is to make sure you have access to a
computer on which you can do the homework, and to get the assignments onto that
computer. Read more about it [here](setup/README.md).

Here is an overview of the homeworks for the academic year 2023-2024:
